Project: Online Video Game Store


Overview of the project: Video game web store that manages inventory and allows
users to purchase games directly. The website also allows users to search and
filter games based on genre, publisher, platform, ERB rating, etc. Based on
search and purchase history, the web site will suggest related games to the
customer that they may be interested in purchasing.

Subdirectories:
  HTML/PHP: Will contain files including both HTML and PHP. Examples of the HTML
    files will include Homepage and template page for games. PHP files will
    contain procedures to generate parts of the HTML pages.
  Tables: Will contain the SQL files that create the tables. The tables in this
    directory will be the same as the ones in the ERD than we previously created.
